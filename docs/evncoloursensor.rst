``EVNColourSensor`` -- Light & colour measurements
==================================================

This class provides the following features and functionalities for our Colour Sensor Standard Peripheral (TCS34725 IC):

    * Reflected Red, Green, Blue (RGB) & Clear Light Measurements
    * Non-Blocking & Blocking Read Functions
    * Configurable Gain and Integration Times
    * Built-in I2C Port Selection and De-selection

.. note:: This class does I2C port selection and de-selection automatically, so users do not need to call ``setPort()`` using their EVNAlpha objects.

Constructor
-----------

.. class:: EVNColourSensor(uint8_t port, uint8_t integration_cycles = 1, uint8_t gain = GAIN_16X)

    :param port: I2C port the sensor is connected to (1-16)
    :param integration_cycles: Number of 2.4ms integration cycle for one reading
    :param gain: Gain applied to readings

        * ``GAIN_1X`` -- 1x gain
        * ``GAIN_4X`` -- 4x gain
        * ``GAIN_16X`` -- 16x gain
        * ``GAIN_60X`` -- 60x gain

Functions
---------

.. function:: bool begin()

    Initializes colour sensor. Call this function before using the other functions.

    :returns: Boolean indicating whether the sensor was successfully initialized. If ``false`` is returned, all other functions will return 0.

.. note::
    If ``begin()`` returns ``false``, try checking your connections and I2C port number!

.. function:: void setGain(uint8_t gain)

    Sets internal sensor gain applied to reading. Increasing gain widens the numeric range of readings at the cost of noise.

    :param gain: Gain applied to readings

        * ``GAIN_1X`` -- 1x gain
        * ``GAIN_4X`` -- 4x gain
        * ``GAIN_16X`` -- 16x gain
        * ``GAIN_60X`` -- 60x gain


.. function:: void setIntegrationCycles(uint8_t integration_cycles)

    Sets the number of 2.4ms integration cycles used for 1 reading.

    integration time = 2.4ms * integration cycles

    :param integration_cycles: Number of 2.4ms integration cycles for 1 reading

Reading Raw RGBC Values
"""""""""""""""""""""""

.. function::   uint16_t read(bool blocking = true)
                uint16_t readClear(bool blocking = true)

    Returns raw clear reading from sensor.

    :param blocking: Block function from returning a value until a new reading is obtained. Defaults to ``true``

    :returns: raw clear reading

.. function:: uint16_t readRed(bool blocking = true)

    Returns raw red reading from sensor.

    :param blocking: Block function from returning a value until a new reading is obtained. Defaults to ``true``

    :returns: raw red reading

.. function:: uint16_t readGreen(bool blocking = true)

    Returns raw green reading from sensor.

    :param blocking: Block function from returning a value until a new reading is obtained. Defaults to ``true``

    :returns: raw green reading

.. function:: uint16_t readBlue(bool blocking = true)

    Returns raw blue reading from sensor.

    :param blocking: Block function from returning a value until a new reading is obtained. Defaults to ``true``

    :returns: raw blue reading

Reading Calibrated RGBC Values
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Before reading calibrated values, you need to call the ``setXXrange()`` function for a given colour channel first.

.. function:: void setClearRange(uint16_t low, uint16_t high)
    
    Sets the range of possible clear values used for calibrating raw values.

    Calibrated Clear Reading = (Clear Raw - Clear Low) / (Clear High - Clear Low)

    If this function is not called, ``readClearCal()`` returns 0;

    :param low: lower bound of readings for Clear channel

    :param high: upper bound of readings for Clear channel

.. function:: void setRedRange(uint16_t low, uint16_t high)
    
    Sets the range of possible red values used for calibrating raw values.

    Calibrated Red Reading = (Red Raw - Red Low) / (Red High - Red Low)

    If this function is not called, ``readRedCal()`` returns 0;

    :param low: lower bound of readings for Red channel

    :param high: upper bound of readings for Red channel

.. function:: void setGreenRange(uint16_t low, uint16_t high)
    
    Sets the range of possible green values used for calibrating raw values.

    Calibrated Green Reading = (Green Raw - Green Low) / (Green High - Green Low)

    If this function is not called, ``readGreenCal()`` returns 0;

    :param low: lower bound of readings for Green channel

    :param high: upper bound of readings for Green channel

.. function:: void setBlueRange(uint16_t low, uint16_t high)
    
    Sets the range of possible blue values used for calibrating raw values.

    Calibrated Blue Reading = (Blue Raw - Blue Low) / (Blue High - Blue Low)

    If this function is not called, ``readBlueCal()`` returns 0;

    :param low: lower bound of readings for Blue channel

    :param high: upper bound of readings for Blue channel

After calling these functions, you can use the ``readXXCal()`` functions.

.. function:: double readClearCal(bool blocking = true)

    Returns calibrated clear reading from sensor.

    Calibrated Clear Reading = (Clear Raw - Clear Low) / (Clear High - Clear Low)

    :param blocking: Block function from returning a value until a new reading is obtained. Defaults to ``true``

    :returns:

        * if ``setClearRange()`` has been called, calibrated clear reading from 0 to 1
        * -1 otherwise

.. function:: double readRedCal(bool blocking = true)
    
    Returns calibrated red reading from sensor.

    Calibrated Red Reading = (Red Raw - Red Low) / (Red High - Red Low)

    :param blocking: Block function from returning a value until a new reading is obtained. Defaults to ``true``

    :returns:

        * if ``setRedRange()`` has been called, calibrated red reading from 0 to 1
        * -1 otherwise

.. function:: double readGreenCal(bool blocking = true)
    
    Returns calibrated green reading from sensor.

    Calibrated Green Reading = (Green Raw - Green Low) / (Green High - Green Low)

    :param blocking: Block function from returning a value until a new reading is obtained. Defaults to ``true``

    :returns:

        * if ``setGreenRange()`` has been called, calibrated green reading from 0 to 1
        * -1 otherwise

.. function:: double readBlueCal()
    
    Returns calibrated blue reading from sensor.

    Calibrated Blue Reading = (Blue Raw - Blue Low) / (Blue High - Blue Low)

    :param blocking: Block function from returning a value until a new reading is obtained. Defaults to ``true``

    :returns:

        * if ``setBlueRange()`` has been called, calibrated blue reading from 0 to 1
